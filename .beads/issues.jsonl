{"id":"bd-chj","title":"fastmcp_rust breaking change: StreamableHttpTransport queue types switched to VecDeque","description":"Upstream fastmcp_rust introduced a breaking API change in StreamableHttpTransport queue helpers:\n\n- request_queue(): Arc<Mutex<Vec<JsonRpcRequest>>> -> Arc<Mutex<VecDeque<JsonRpcRequest>>>\n- response_queue(): Arc<Mutex<Vec<JsonRpcResponse>>> -> Arc<Mutex<VecDeque<JsonRpcResponse>>>\n\nWhy: dequeue operations were changed from O(n) Vec::remove(0) to O(1) VecDeque::pop_front for stream-load reliability.\n\nRequired migration in this repo:\n1. Update explicit queue type annotations/imports to VecDeque.\n2. Replace queue operations with VecDeque APIs (push_back, pop_front).\n3. Re-run compile/tests for all MCP transport call-sites.\n\nReference upstream commit: 20ee715 in fastmcp_rust.","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-02-13T17:38:55.024645921Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-02-13T17:38:55.024645921Z","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0}
